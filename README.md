## Description

Charcoal is being developed to give creators a place to develop and share their characters.
Whether they simply be OCs or if they want to do something more by adding data for D&D, Pathfinder, or any other TTRPG!

We also aim to give developers the tools to easily import your characters into their games and apps!

## FAQ

### Why Charcoal?

When we were trying to come up with names we wanted something that could tie into the D&D scene, but we didn't want anything that's been _heavily_ overused. We eventually settled on Charcoal because throughout points in history (and even now) charcoal has been used not only as a writing medium, but also as an artistic one. Whether you're a creator, a dungeon master, or a player we're all crafting the stories of our characters. We're painting a beautiful canvas that is their story for everyone around us to see.
